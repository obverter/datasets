# datasets

 Interesting corpora I've found on the Information Superhighway.

## Books

The Hathi datasets comprise a ton of wonderful data about historical NYT Bestseller Lists, winners of literature prizes with purses >10,000 USD, and graduates of the [Iowa Writers' Workshop](https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu).

These corpora have all been poached from [Post45](https://view.data.post45.org/index) by way of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool). They were posted in as tsv files. I've converted them to csv and included those in a separate directory.
